            <h2>What is Open Source?</h2>
            <p>Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is
                code that is designed to be publicly accessibleâ€”anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they
                see fit. Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer
                review and community production. Open source refers to a program in which the source code is available
                to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge. Open source
                code is typically created as a collaborative effort in which programmers improve upon the code and share
                the changes within the community. Open source sprouted in the technological community as a response to
                proprietary software owned by corporations.</p>
