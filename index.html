                <h2>What is Open Source?</h2>
                <p>Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is
                    code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as
                    they
                    see fit. Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer
                    review and community production. Open source refers to a program in which the source code is
                    available
                    to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge. Open
                    source
                    code is typically created as a collaborative effort in which programmers improve upon the code and
                    share
                    the changes within the community. Open source sprouted in the technological community as a response
                    to
                    proprietary software owned by corporations.</p>

                <h2>Why Open Source?</h2>
                <p>Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
                    "Source
                    code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer
                    programmers
                    can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who
                    have
                    access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or
                    fixing
                    parts that don't always work correctly. Open source software benefits users by allowing them to have
                    more
                    control over the software they use. Since open source software is freely available, users can look
                    at the
                    source code and develop the software further according to their needs. Open source software is also
                    more
                    secure than closed source software because users can detect and fix security flaws. Open source
                    software
                    is also more reliable than closed source software because it is developed by a community of
                    developers
                    who are constantly improving the software.</p>
